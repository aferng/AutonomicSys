                <p style="font-size:18px">Autonomic Systems LLC (ANS) is an Arizona-based company focused on innovating and developing unique systems solutions for cardiac health. We are developing a next generation and previously unattained solution for personalized cardiac monitoring. ANS integrates true 24/7 monitoring, a clinically driven user-specific assessment, and real-time notification for life threatening cardiac conditions, combined into a tiny, wearable device, operating without user intervention. Our proprietary approach to overseeing heart health is patent protected and encompasses novel algorithmic solutions and system designs.<p>
                <p style="font-size:18px">In the U.S. today, approximately 6 million adults have atrial fibrillation (AFib), putting them at an increased risk of stroke with 1 in 4 experiencing some form of heart failure. As many as 30% of these cases go undiagnosed until debilitating complications occur. AFib alone is attributed as causing over 130,000 deaths and 750,000 hospitalizations annually.</p>
                <p style="font-size:18px">Detection of AFib and immediate treatment can potentially avert many of the debilitating effects and provides the best approach to saving lives. ANS has intellectual property, has engineered the technology, and has taken the approach and tactic necessary to solve this problem.</p>
                <p style="font-size:18px">Currently, the company is developing expertise around the application of heart rate monitoring in a way that can provide real-time alerting about changes in a user’s physiological condition. Academic studies have shown that early detection and preventative actions taken can effectively reduce the incidence of mortality due to cardiac events. </p>
                <p style="font-size:18px">On a clinical level, monitoring can be used to alert the user to changes in their health and physiological status. For non-clinical applications, such as during endurance sports, athletes can use our technology to help examine their lactate threshold and other cardiovascular health parameters to help maximize efficiency, performance, and recovery.</p>
                <p style="font-size:18px">Wearable technology has been developed by ANS that can be incorporated into chest straps, patches, garments, and many other variations of wearable devices. Our hardware utilizes ultra-low power components to ensure an extended battery life, and the use of low energy Bluetooth for remote real-time alerting. Proprietary algorithms have been developed to handle clinically-specified, user-personalized analysis and assessment on a real time basis.</p>
